will compare two of the<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> top rich musicians in Nigeria</a>, I am positive you will love it.</span></p><p><span>I was really cracking my head on how to format this whole post because I didn’t want to go off the rail.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Luckily I now have a way to do just that and still keep it as relevant as possible.</span></p><p><span>Let’s start with Flavour bio and Phyno bio&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>worth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>How about that?&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section

bio of Phyno and Flavour… It will cover things like where these guys practically grew up, what their life was like, and more.</span></p><p><span>There is always that difference in the life of a

Bio</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Flavour is a Nigerian musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The reason I decided to treat this as a topic is simply that this Phyno and Flavour hail from Anambra State.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I think Nigerians got lots of musicians who hail from the eastern state. because I know<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> Mr P and his twin brother Rudeboy also hails from there</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Flavour is the son of the soil but growing up away from home could mean a different experience altogether.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></p><p><span>Flavour was born in 1983 precisely November 23rd which in a Christian calendar is just 7 days away. from the last month of the year which is the month of Xmas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, if I said Flavour grew away from home, I believe that prompts questions like Where was Flavour born?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Flavour 36 was born in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer follow external" data-wpel-link=external class=wpel-icon-right>Enugu state<span class="wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-6"></span></a>, spend most of his early life in the church learning how to play an instrument.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I mean sources tell Shoutmeceleb.com that he was so good with the drum before moving to learn to play the Piano.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Phyno_Bio></span><span><b>Phyno Bio</b></span><span
