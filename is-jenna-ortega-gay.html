She has done work for Marvel, Disney, and HBO and her next Netflix production will be released on Wednesday, so she certainly deserves all the acclaim she’s getting. Some of the most well-known works feature contributions by Jenna Ortega.</p><p>She is an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights and anti-discrimination who is eager to contribute to whatever discussion she can.
