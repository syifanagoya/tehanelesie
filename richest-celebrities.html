He attended junior high school in Los Angeles with future stars like will.i.am and GoonRock. He then attended Palisades Charter High School in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, graduating in 1993. By that time, he was already working as a producer for friends and local musicians.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1994, Redfoo experienced his first commercial success when he scored a production credit for the song "Back in the Day" by Los Angeles Rapper Ahmed.

He signed them to Interscope/will.i.am Music.

The album charted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 album charts and snagged the second spot on the Billboard Dance Chart.
