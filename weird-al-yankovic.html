After three years, Al Yankovic began teaching himself how to play the accordion and rock ‘n’ roll music by listening to Elton John tunes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At a young age, he was inspired by comedians such as Frank Zappa, Shel Silverstein, and Spike Jones.

Yankovic first became known as “Weird Al” while studying architecture at Cal Poly and working as a DJ for the school’s radio station. Yankovic’s nickname was really a negative label bestowed upon him by his classmates, but he decided to “take it on professionally.”</p><p>Since having a comedic song played on The Dr. Demento Radio Show in 1976 at the age of 16, Yankovic has sold over 12 million albums (as of 2015), released over 150 parodies and original songs, and performed over 1,000 live events. His work has garnered him five Grammy Awards and 11 nominations, as well as four gold and six platinum recordings in the United States. In 2006, nearly three decades into his career, he released his first top-ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single (“White & Nerdy”).
