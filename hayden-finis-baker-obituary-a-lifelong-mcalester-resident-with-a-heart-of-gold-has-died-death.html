On that day, the town mourned the loss of one of its own, Hayden Finis Baker, a dedicated lifelong resident, who passed away peacefully at the age of 67. Hayden’s presence in McAlester was woven into the fabric of the town, and his legacy will undoubtedly live on. Hayden’s journey began on January 25, 1956, when he was born to Hayden J. Baker and Edith Irene Rowe, in the very town he would call home throughout his life. McAlester was not just a place of residence for Hayden; it was a part of his identity. His roots ran deep, connecting him to the history and community that he cherished.</p><p>After graduating from McAlester High School, Hayden found his passion lay in working with his hands. This led him to establish his own contracting business as a painter. For him, this was more than just a profession; it was a craft he took immense pride in. His dedication and skill shone through in every project he undertook, leaving a trail of satisfied clients and beautifully painted homes. But Hayden’s impact extended far beyond his professional life. He was a true handyman at heart, and his love for fixing things around the house was well-known in the community. Whether it was a leaky faucet, a creaky door, or a broken window, Hayden was always ready to lend a hand.</p><p>His ability to solve problems and his willingness to help others became defining traits that endeared him to his family and friends. Hayden’s surviving family members include his sisters, Sharon Johnson, Connie Barringer, and Patricia Martin, all of McAlester. He also leaves behind his brother, David Ramsey, who resided in California. In addition, he had aunts Christine Bramlett of Wewoka and Gwen Griffith of Allan. Beyond his immediate family, Hayden was a cherished stepfather to Kathy, Sandra, Kerry, Allisa, and Jason. His memory will be held dear by his numerous nieces, nephews, and other extended family members, as well as his many friends.</p><p>Sadly, Hayden had to say goodbye to several loved ones before his passing. He was preceded in death by his wife, Terry D. Baker, his parents Edith and Hayden J. Baker, his brother Dewane Ramsey, and his grandmothers, Nellie Hicks and Dora Griffith. His niece, Bryliegh White, also holds a special place in his heart and memory. Hayden Finis Baker’s legacy is one of hard work, dedication, and a willingness to support and uplift those around him. In his presence, the people of McAlester found a friend and neighbor who could always be counted on, whether for a fresh coat of paint or a helping hand. As the community mourns his passing, they also celebrate the life of a remarkable man who will forever remain a cherished part of McAlester’s history.</p><p>Hayden’s memory will live on, not just in the town he loved but in the hearts of all those whose lives he touched. He leaves behind a legacy of kindness and community spirit that serves as an enduring testament to the impact one person can have on the world around them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtMCym56mXZu2r7XSZpmao5WnerCuyK2smqqpYq5uuMifnKWnnpx6rq%2FApZysrJWnerOx0qKbnqakYsSqwMdmmGaglZa%2FtXnOn2Sgp5yZeqmt0mabop2UYrGmrdOhZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rece-davis-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rece Davis Bio (Wiki)</a>
